          This policy outlines the terms regarding refunds for payments made for
          services provided by UnionCore Energy.
        </p>
        <h2>General Policy</h2>
        <p>
          Payments made for energy consumption are generally non-refundable.
          UnionCore Energy provides an essential utility service, and payments
          cover the cost of energy already delivered and consumed by the
          customer.
        </p>
        <h2>Overpayments</h2>
        <p>
          In the event of an overpayment to your account, the excess amount will
          be applied as a credit to your account balance. This credit will be
          automatically used to offset future charges on your subsequent bills.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you close your account and have a credit balance, a refund check for
          the credit amount will be mailed to your forwarding address within
          30-60 days of your final bill.
        </p>
        <h2>Billing Errors</h2>
        <p>
          If you believe there has been a billing error, please contact our
          customer service department immediately through our Help & Support
          page. We will investigate the issue promptly. If a billing error is
          confirmed on our part, we will correct your account balance
          accordingly. This may result in a credit to your account.
        </p>
        <h2>Service Deposits</h2>
        <p>
          Security deposits collected at the start of service are refundable.
          After a period of satisfactory payment history (typically 12 months) or
          upon closing your account in good standing, your deposit plus any
          accrued interest will be applied as a credit to your account or
          refunded to you.
        </p>
